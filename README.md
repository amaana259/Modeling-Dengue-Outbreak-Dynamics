**Modeling the system dynamics of dengue outbreaks in Karachi.**

This repository details the work done in our FYP for our Modeling the Environment course ENV 244 at LUMS by Dr. Talha Manzoor. 

We implemented a 3-layer model on Vensim, each layer capturing an integral component of the system that drives dengue outbreaks.

We aim to use this model to allow us to understand the dynamics of what contributes to an outbreak of dengue and what steps can be taken to mitigate these occurrences.

The model allows for experimentations with planned interventions to target the main contributing factors of dengue spread. 

The effect of these interventions and particularly any side effects can be learned through the model and experimentation, given that enough historical data is available to support the model's functionality and/or improve upon it.

Also created a mock research paper, based on the ACM format.
